# Titanic-EDA-Task
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. It includes handling missing values, analyzing key features like age, sex, and class, and visualizing survival patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib. The goal is to understand the data and prepare it for future predictive modeling.
